Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

The Scalyr Agent {{ .Values.controllerType }} was deployed successfully and is up and running.

Given the specified Scalyr server and api key values were correct, head over to your Scalyr dashboard
({{- if contains "eu." $.Values.scalyr.server }}https://app.eu.scalyr.com{{ else }}https://app.scalyr.com{{- end }}) to see the first incoming log data.

You can retrieve information about the agent pod(s) by running the following command:

  kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "scalyr-helm.name" . }}" -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}"

To view pod info and logs and verify that the pod has started without any errors, you can use the
following commands:

  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "scalyr-helm.name" . }}" -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl describe pod "${POD_NAME}"
  kubectl logs -f "${POD_NAME}"
